# Day 7: Personal Notes

## What I Learned Today

## Key Concepts
1. **if statement**: Execute code if condition is true
2. **elif**: Check additional conditions
3. **else**: Execute if all conditions are false
4. **Comparison operators**: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
5. **Logical operators**: and, or, not

## Conditional Statements Cheatsheet
```python
# Basic if
if condition:
    # code

# if-else
if condition:
    # code
else:
    # code

# if-elif-else
if condition1:
    # code
elif condition2:
    # code
else:
    # code

# Comparison operators
==  # equal to
!=  # not equal to
>   # greater than
<   # less than
>=  # greater than or equal
<=  # less than or equal

# Logical operators
and  # both must be true
or   # at least one must be true
not  # reverse the condition
```

## DevOps Use Cases
- **Health checks**: Validate server metrics
- **Environment logic**: Different behavior per environment
- **Alerts**: Trigger based on thresholds
- **Validation**: Check input before processing

## Practice Summary
- [ ] Completed health_checker.py
- [ ] Completed env_validator.py
- [ ] Completed alert_system.py
